# REST

- Roy Feilding helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.
- Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
  - Because that wasn't a primary concern when Roy Feilding was building this.
- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? 
  - REST
- What does a GET do?
  - retrieves data that already exists from a server
- What does a POST do?
  - sends data to a server
- What does PUT do?
  - replaces data that already exists on server
- What does PATCH do?
  - modifies data that already exists on a server
- REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer

## Things I want to know more about
