# What Google learned from building teams

## Notes:

- Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google's teams.
- "As long as everyone had a chance to talk, the team did well, but if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declines" - Anita Woolley
- We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The "who" part of the equation didn't seem to matter." - Anita Woolley
- Psychological Safety - a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking and a sense of confidence that the team will not embarras, reject, or punish someone for speaking up (Amy Edmondson)
- Google's data indicated that psychological safety was critical to making a team work.
- Sakaguchi believes that psychological safety and emotional conversations were related. Conversational turn-taking and empathy are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to. As individuals, we need to establish a bond.
- Today's winners deserve to triumph because they are cleareyed enough to discard yesterday's conventional wisdoms and search out the disruptive and the new.
- "Just having data that proves to people that these things are worth paying attentioin to sometimes is the most important step in getting them to actually pay attention." - Rozovsky
