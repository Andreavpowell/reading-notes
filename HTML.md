## Wireframe Steps
1. Do your research - who is your audience, detailing reqs, user personas and use cases, competitor and industry research
2. Prepare research for reference - create sketch of business and user goals, your personas, use cases, and features you found during step 1
3. Map out user flow - consider what goes on what page, how many buttons the user has to press, how to go to different pages, etc
4. Draft, don't draw. Sketch, don't illustrate. - don't think css, think HTML, organize to user goals, what info should be prominent, what will the user expect to see, which buttons do you need where, create a few variations
5. Detail and Testing - prototype skeleton, usability conventions, instructional wording, trust-building, tooltips, UsabilityHub, Prott
6. Create Prototype - Proto(dot)io, Adobe XD, Framer, Sketch, Figma, second round of testing, 

## Key Principles

# HTML Basics

## HTML
* Element - everything within 2 tags, including the tags
* Tags - <>
* Content - everything within 2 tags
* Attributes - extra info about the element that doesn't show in actual content and should always have:
  * space between it and the element
  * attribute name then =
  * value wrapped by ""
* The `class` attribulte gives elements an identifier to target it with style info
* What comes after the = is the attribute value

## Nesting Elements
* `<p>My dog is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>`

## Empty Elements
* `<img src="images/url" alt="My test image">`

## HTML Document
* `<!DOCTYPE html>` - doctype
* `<html></html>`
* `<head></head>`
* `<meta charset="utf-8">` - sets character set for your doc to UTF-8 which includes most characters from most languages
* `<title></title>`
* `<body></body>`

# Marking up text

## Headings
* `<hi>` - main
* `<h2>` - top level
* `<h3>` - subheading
* `<h4>` - sub-subheading

## Paragraphs
* `<p></p>`

## Lists
* `<ul></ul>` - unordered
* `<ol></ol>` - ordered
* `<li></li>` - put in front of every list item

## Links
* `<a></a>` - anchor
* `href` - hypertext reference
* `<a href="image.url">alt text</a>`

# Semantics
* The meaning of a piece of code

## JavaScript
* `createLiWithContent(peach)`

## CSS
