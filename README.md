# Reading Notes for CodeFellows

This is my reading notes repo to track all of my reading notes.

## About Me

My name is Andrea Powell. I am a student at CodeFellows with an eagerness to learn and implement all the wonderful skills I learn here into my future career as a Software Developer.

### Growth Mindset

Working with a team comprimised of people who fully understand and embrace the Growth Mindest is, in my opinion, one of the most important aspects of leading a successful career regardless of the industry. Following this particular mindset is not only about growing the company that you work with, but about growing yourself and setting an unwavering example for your coworkers so that you can all lift each other together towards success as a team AND individually. When you focus your own personal efforts towards growth, everything else begins to grow with you instead of falling stagnant.
