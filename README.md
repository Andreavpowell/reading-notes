# Reading Notes for CodeFellows

This is my reading notes repo to track all of my reading notes.

### About Me

My name is Andrea Powell. I am a student at CodeFellows with an eagerness to learn and implement all the wonderful skills I learn here into my future career as a Software Developer. My personal hobbies (when I'm not in front of my computer) revolve around being anywhere that *isn't* inside. This includes everything from hiking and camping to rock climbing and kayaking.

### Growth Mindset

Working with a team comprised of people who fully understand and embrace the Growth Mindset is, in my opinion, one of the most important aspects of leading a successful career regardless of the industry. Following this particular mindset is not only about growing the company that you work with, but also growing yourself and setting an unwavering example for your coworkers so that you can all lift each other together towards success as a team ***AND*** individually. When you focus your own personal efforts towards growth, everything else begins to grow with you instead of falling stagnant. 

#### Three reminders to myself of how to maintain a Growth Mindset:

- Keep constant, constructive communication with my teammates.
- Embrace any criticism given to me, no matter who it may have come from.
- Always congratulate and be inspired by anyone that succeeds. Never allow jealousy to intervene.
