# HTML, CSS, JS Basics

## Text
- HTML elements describe the structure of the page
- provide semantic info - carried in elements like `<cite>` and `<em>`
- structural markup includes elements like `<h1>` and `<p>`

## Introducing CSS
- associates style rules with HTML elements
- has selector and declaration
- declarations have property and value separated by a colon
- CSS treats HTML elements as if it's in it's own box and uses rules to determine how it looks
- CSS usually in a different document

## Basic JavaScript
- before using a variable, you must announce that you want to use it
- give the variable a name (declaring)
- you assign values to variables
- script is series of statements
- scripts contain very precise instructions
- variables temp store pieces of info in the script
- arrays store more than one piece of related info
- JS distinguishes between 0-9, strings, and boolean values
- expressions - single value
- expressions rely on operators to calc value

## Decisions and Loops
- use flowcharts for decisions
- diamond shape - point where decision must be made
- set a condition 
- true, take one path
- fals, take another
- comparison operators allow you to compare values and test
- comparison operators use `<`, `>`, and `==`
- two components to a decision:
  - expression is evaluated and returns a value
  - conditional statement says what to do in what situations
- comparison operators
  - `==` - is equal to 
  - `!=` - is not equal to
  - `===` - strict equal to 
  - `!==` - strict not equal to
  - `<` - greater than
  - `>` - less than
  - `<=` - greater than or equal to
  - `>=` - less than or equal to
- any condition is usually one operator and two operands
- operands are placed on either side of operator
- operands can be values or variables and enclosed in brackets
- operand does not have to be a single value
- logical operators allow you to compare results of more than one comparison operator
  - `&&` - logical and
  - `||` - logical or
  - `!` - logical not
- if statements
  - evaluates or checks a condition
- if else statements
  - checks a condition if true, first code block is executed
  - if not, second block is executed
- switch statements
  - starts with a switch value
  - each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should be run if the variable matches
- loops
  - check a condition
  - if true, code will be run
  - check again, if still true will repeat until false
  - for - code run specific number of times
  - while - dont know how many times
  - do while - always tun statements unside curly braces at least once even if false
- loop counters
  - initialization - `var i = 0;`
  - condition - `i < 10;`
  - update - `i++`
